# Find Out Their Name Challeng

This code has the objective to solve an challenge for a Junior NodeJS Engineer position.

## Description

This challenge is pretty straightforward and aims not only to test you code skills but also you figuring out skills.

You'll have 4 hints about a random Brazilian name and your job is to write a script that tries to find it out.

These are the hints:

- Contains 4 vowels
- Starts with “ma”
- Has 4 syllabes
- One of the syllabes is “di”

The script doesn't have to guess the one right name, it's ok to print a couple of names.
